## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Deduplicated count-badge styling into a shared `CountBadge` component (feed
  entry-count pill and photo `+N` overflow pill previously duplicated the
  same inline styles).
- Tightened `Card`'s `style` prop typing to `StyleProp<ViewStyle>`.
- Added accessibility labels/roles to icon-only controls (`Fab`, and the
  edit/delete `IconButton`s in the Tags screen).
